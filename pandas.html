                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <P>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</P>
    <p>Although pandas have very few natural predators, they are at risk of being preyed on by jackals, leopards and yellow-throated martens, a type of weasel that feeds on panda cubs. Snow leopards are a definite threat to panda bears, as they reside in the same mountainous areas of central China.</p>
    <p>In the wild, giant pandas typically nap between feedings for two to four hours at a time, snoozing on their side, back, or belly, either sprawled or curled up. While a giant panda is resting, it continues to defecate.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the pandas at the panda canyon.</p>
